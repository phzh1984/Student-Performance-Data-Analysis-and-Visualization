# Student-Performance-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

Introduction

The goal of this project is to understand the influence of various factors, such as the students' parents' background, test preparation, and other relevant variables, on student performance.

Analyzing student performance is essential for several reasons:

Assessment of Learning: Teachers continuously assess student work to gauge their understanding and progress in various subjects.

Improving Teaching: Examining student performance allows educators to revise and enhance their teaching methods to better support student learning.

Continuous Quality Improvement: Ongoing assessment helps teachers engage in continuous quality improvement of their courses, making the educational experience more effective and engaging.

Identifying Influencing Factors: Understanding the various factors affecting student performance, such as parental background and test preparation, can help educators and policymakers make informed decisions to enhance the overall education system.
